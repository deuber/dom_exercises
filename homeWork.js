# DOM Exercises

To get started, fork this repository to make a copy of it on your github account. Next, clone your copy from github onto your computer.  

Navigate into your new `dom_exercises` directory and open the code in sublime with `subl .`. 

Inside `dom_exercises`, there is a directory for each part of the lab. Each directory has its own README.md with instructions. The order for the four parts is:

1. `ids`
2. `forms`
3. `collections`
4. `events` 

Remember to collaborate, do smart searches, and refer back to [lecture notes](https://github.com/sf-wdi-18/notes)!
